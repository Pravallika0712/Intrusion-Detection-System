# Smart Signature-based Intrusion Analysis System with Pre-Scaled Learning for Large Networks

## Description
This repository contains the research paper presented at the 2024 International Conference on Computing and Intelligent Reality Technologies (ICCIRT), published on IEEE Xplore (ISBN: 979-8-3315-1029-9). The paper proposes a smart signature-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) enhanced with pre-scaled machine learning techniques for large-scale networks. It compares Signature-based IDS (SIDS) and Anomaly-based IDS (AIDS), evaluates clustering algorithms like K-Means and DBSCAN, and demonstrates K-Means' effectiveness in distinguishing benign and malicious network traffic. The study also explores deployment on cloud and host-based systems, using techniques like TCP dumps, registry monitoring, and data usage analysis.

## Key Contributions
- Comparative analysis of Signature-based IDS (SIDS) and Anomaly-based IDS (AIDS) for threat detection.
- Evaluation of clustering algorithms, with K-Means outperforming DBSCAN (accuracy: 0.75, f1-score: 0.73) in detecting benign vs. malicious traffic.
- Integration of machine learning for enhanced detection of unknown threats and scalability in large networks.
- Deployment strategies for cloud-based and host-based IDS, leveraging TCP dumps, registry edits, and data usage monitoring.
- Future directions for IDS, including AI advancements, quantum resistance, and privacy-preserving techniques.

## Dataset
The research utilizes the "Friday-Working Hours" dataset, available on Kaggle:  
[Friday-Working Hours Afternoon DDoS Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishasingh03/fidayworkinghours-afternoon-ddos)  
The dataset contains 85 columns and 900,000 rows, with features like Flow Duration, Total Fwd Packets, and labels for BENIGN or DDoS traffic.
